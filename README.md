# Integrated Therapy Software

## Overview
This project combines Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques with relationship-building guidance to treat depression. Our goal is to enhance patient outcomes by leveraging social support along with CBT in a computerized therapy device.

## Clinical Problem
Approximately 280 million people suffer from depression globally, yet many lack access to treatment due to stigma and a shortage of professionals. Computerized CBT devices help address this gap but often neglect the benefits of positive social relationships, which play a crucial role in reducing depression.

## Our Solution
We aim to create a holistic solution by integrating relationship-building with CBT. The system guides users through four stages of growth:

1. **Trust**: Building rapport and encouraging vulnerability.
2. **Support**: Using CBT techniques to change negative thought patterns.
3. **Connection**: Helping users build positive relationships and share their mental health challenges.
4. **Accountability**: Supporting consistent, healthy relationships with accountability for both users and their support partners.

## Solution Strategy
We simplify the prototype by using existing large language models and API-based conversational logic for CBT. Our focus is on the unique aspects of relationship-building and accountability, creating an accessible tool for depression treatment.

## Product Development Focus
This project offers hands-on experience with:
- User research
- Journey mapping
- Validation testing
- Iterative development
- Project documentation

## Goals and Impact
Our aim is to showcase how AI can strengthen human connection, not replace it. While commercialization is not planned, this project will provide valuable experience in designing solutions that meet complex user needs.
